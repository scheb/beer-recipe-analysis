beer-recipe-analysis
====================

Playing around with Python to **analyze beer brewing recipes**.

The goal of this project is to use the power of data analysis to get a better idea how different styles of beer are
brewed. Among other things, I want to find out which ingredients are commonly used and how much in relation to each
other.
